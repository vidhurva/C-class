# C-class
C++ Program using class, public and direct member access
// Hello fellow programmer or internet streamer!
// I have attached a picture of my class program. 
// The syntax used throughout the program demonstrates how using class and public is performed.
// For box 1, the user is required to give dimensions of their box while the dimensions of box 2 already has values. 
// Double should be used instead of int incase the user has a decimal answer
// The variables Box1 Box2 refers to the Box class that was created before the int main.
